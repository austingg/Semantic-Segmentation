### spn: learning affinity from spatial propogation network. NIPS2017. 
* We propose spattial propagation networks for learning the affinity for vision tasks. 
* The model can learn semantically-aware affinity value for high-level vision tasks due to the powerful learning capability of deep CNNs. 
* Valide the framework on the task of ** refinement of image segmentation boundaries**. Experiments show that the spatial propagation network provides a general, effictive and efficient solution for generating **high-quality segmentation results**.
